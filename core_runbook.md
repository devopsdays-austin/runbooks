# Core Runbook

The core organizers are a group of three organizers who provide the structure for the organizing team.

## Role description

This role is responsible for the conference being held each year. They set the tone, the pace of organizing, and the overall theme (with input from the rest of the organizing team). Cores are responsible for finalizing all decisions, and they own the budget each year.

### General Tasks

* Approve finance requests.
* Define the budget for the year.
* Define the organizing team each year.
* Run weekly meetings.
* Maintain the organizing boards and tasks.
* Be the final decision makers.
* Support all functions.
* MC the conference.
* Handle all code of conduct concerns before, during, and after the conference.

### Time Expectations

This role is the most time-intensive of the conference organizing team. Expect to spend 4-5 hours a week most weeks spread out across multiple days in responding to feedback reuqests or addressing core functions. Core should meet weekly from early September through the week after the conference in May, and likely will meet monthly or bimonthly in May through August.

Response times, unless agreed upon by the rest of core in the case of vacations, emergencies, or family/employment duties, usually are within 24 hours during the week and within 48 hours on weekends and holidays. Family and work responsibilities come first, and core organizers are responsible for notifying co-cores should another responsibility need to take priority longer than 24 hours.
