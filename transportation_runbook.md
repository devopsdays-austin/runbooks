- Contact [CharterUp](https://www.charterup.com/charter-bus-rentals/austin-charter-bus-rental/) and get a quote for shuttle bus service to and from the overflow parking area. The shuttle should run every fifteen minutes starting at 7:45 am until 6:00 pm.

## Notes on Current Venue - Texas Computer Education Associate (TCEA)

The [TCEA](https://tcea.org/) is a non-profit that works primarily with educators to provide support for computer based education. Parking at the Texas Computer Education Association (TCEA) is pretty good, with a total of 192 parking spots plus 15 additional on the road.

## Notes on Transportation to Happy Hour

Happy Hour shuttle service should nominally be handled with three different buses. 

- 50 person charter bus: This is for the initial shuttle to kick off Happy Hour.
- Two ten person busses: These will start rotating from the venue to Happy Hour so that people don't need to wait around as much.
