## General Notes on Happy Hour

* When it comes to estimating head count for Happy Hour, expect 30% of attendees to show up if the happy hour is not at the venue. If it is at the venue, expect 60% of attendees to go.
* Be careful with overserving. This is not a function to get wasted at.
* If your are hosting the happy hour at another location, you may need to arrange a shuttle or other transportation with the Transportation Organizers.
* Sponsors will need to setup tables at the happy hour so make sure there's room available for them.
* If you host at a bar and use a tab, make sure that the bartenders cap the amount of spend so you don't go over budget.

### 6 Months Out

* Get a quote from the venue for snacks and open bar. If hosting at Meanwhile, use the 2025 food line item as a starting point for budget.

### Two Week Before

## Notes on Current Venue - Texas Computer Education Associate (TCEA)

The [TCEA](https://tcea.org/) is a non-profit that works primarily with educators to provide support for computer based education. We could theoretically host Happy Hour at the venue but we'd need to add extra insurance coverage and figure out how to leverage the space.

There are two nearby breweries that are great spots for Happy Hour: [Meanwhile Brewing](https://www.meanwhilebeer.com/) and [Pinthosue Brewing](https://pinthouse.com/). We hosted the 2025 Happy Hour at Meanwhile Brewing and everyone enjoyed it. We also came in well under budget. Pinthouse has less room and less food options than Meanwhile.
