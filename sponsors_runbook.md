# Sponsor

## Role description

This role is responsible for managing the interaction with sponsors from sales through the overall execution of the event. You are the primary driver of conference revenue.

### General Tasks

* Work with the broader team to define sponsorship opportunities for the event (what offerings are possible, pricing, execution plan, quantity, etc.)
* Manage the sales process of sponsorship opportunities from initial contact through to payment and finally fulfillment
* Manage sponsor communications to ensure that any questions that arise are handled in a timely manner
* Manage sponsor fulfillment during the event and ensure that they have a great experience

### General Guidance on Sponsors
Sponsor revenue is usually the primary income source for the event. Starting as early as possible - ideally as soon as the budget is set - is crucial. Getting sponsors signed on as early as possible represents important cashflow for the event's budget. This is where the cash comes from to pay vendors, etc. Early revenue is particularly important as some of the biggest expenses (venue, catering) expect payment or large deposits up-front and therefore relatively early in the event planning cycle.

* Sponsor experience is important, but it is lower in importance than attendee experience
* Sponsors will ask for all sorts of things - be comfortable saying 'no'
* It is OK to discourage or reject sponsors that do not fit or that might be problematic
* Value the sponsorship opportunities you are selling - if you do not, your sponsors will not
* Do not discount unless there is a very good reason - and do so ONLY with the agreement of the core team. There are a LOT of companies that want to connect with Austin's community, so there is usually someone else who will buy at full price
* Maintain a very short decision loop between yourself and the core organizers - you need to be able to respond to sponsors quickly (think within 12-24 hours) when they ask something off-the-wall
* Maintain a very close working relationship with Laura Wickett (ConferenceOps) - she is awesome and your best operational resource. She also knows what sponsors are doing with other DevOpsDays events.
* Never assume a sponsor understands something or has the correct expectation - ALWAYS send it in writing and do not be afraid to repeat yourself

* Make sure there is a place for Happy Hour sponsors have a place to store their stuff while waiting for setup
* Get sponsor events into run-of-show schedule while the schedule is being created (do not wait for specific speaker scheduling - use 'slot type' placeholders
* Get granular with the Ignite schedule if using those as a structure for sponsor shoutouts (e.g. interspersed)
* Work with marketing coordinator to make noise - announce sponsors as they are confirmed - not just close to the show
* Get the sponsor sales started early enough in Q4 (like around Thanksgiving) to generate interest and catch end-of-year budget
* Update demographic information from prior year's event

## Sponsor Fulfillment Workflow

1. When you receive interest from a sponsor, start tracking it on the [Activity Tab of the Sponsor Tracking Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_5U5akw0YoVowOQ-PH7e0-GTuW07aYk/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108634001071776067504&rtpof=true&sd=true)
2. If you get a verbal commit on a sponsorship, update the Activity Tab and add them to the Fulfillment Tab.
3. Once we have received payment, ask the sponsors for their coprporate logo and a blurb to use for social media posts. Coordinate with the Marketing Organizer to send a sponsor shoutout on social media. Work with the Website Organizer to add the logo to our website.
4. Send a description of their sponsorship level and all entitlements to the sponsor so they have it explicitly spelled out what they've paid for. Send a link to the [Sponsorship FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHkYV2jt4WX-xi9uxCBn6RyLzI6cJdwGLQ-dLpWFMhs/edit?usp=share_link).
5. Follow the rest of the runbook for when to send messages.
