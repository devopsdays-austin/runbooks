# Sponsor

## Role description

This role is responsible for managing the interaction with sponsors from sales through the overall execution of the event

### General Tasks

* Work with the broader team to define sponsorship opportunities for the event (what offerings are possible, pricing, execution plan, quantity, etc.)
* Manage the sales process of sponsorship opportunities from initial contact through to payment
* Manage sponsor communications to ensure eduacation / coordination
* Manage sponsor fulfillment during the event

### General Guidance on Sponsors
Sponsor revenue is usually the primary income source for the event. Starting as early as possible - ideally as soon as the budget is set - is crucial. Getting sponsors signed on as early as possible represents important cashflow for the event's budget. This is where the cash comes from to pay vendors, etc. Early revenue is particularly important as some of the biggest expenses (venue, catering) expect payment or large deposits up-front and therefore relatively early in the event planning cycle.

* Sponsor experience is important, but it is lower in importance than attendee experience
* Sponsors will ask for all sorts of things - be comfortable saying 'no'
* It is OK to discourage or reject sponsors that do not fit or that might be problematic
* Value the sponsorship opportunities you are selling - if you do not, your sponsors will not
* Do not discount unless there is a very good reason - and do so ONLY with the agreement of the core team. There are a LOT of companies that want to connect with Austin's community, so there is usually someone else who will buy at full price
* Maintain a very short decision loop between yourself and the core organizers - you need to be able to respond to sponsors quickly (think within 12-24 hours) when they ask something off-the-wall
* Maintain a very close working relationship with Laura Wickett (ConferenceOps) - she is awesome and your best operational resource. She also knows what sponsors are doing with other DevOpsDays events.
* Never assume a sponsor understands something or has the correct expectation - ALWAYS send it in writing and do not be afraid to repeat yourself
