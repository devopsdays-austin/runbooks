## Important Dates

### In the beginning

### 3 Months Out

- Should unpack and inventory the storage shed and pull equipment that will be used. Next few months should be spent testing equipment and replacing consumables, making cables if necessary, and ordering equipment if necesary. 

### 2 Months Out

- By now volunteer organizer should be getting volunteer counts and have reached out to volunteers, so get your needs over to them. 

### 2 Weeks Out

- Hold training for volunteers

### The Week Before

- Know how equipment is getting to the venue for load-in and have it organized into bins.

### The Day Before

* Set up.

### The Day Of

* Make sure it runs smoothly -- see day-of above

### Afterwards

* Get equipment back to storage shed, and inventory it to make sure everything got there. 
* Get equipment that was packed into bins for each stage sorted back into bins by type of equipment and use. 

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Being involved early with the venue selection is important because you need to know distances, where stages will be, what's already in place from the venue, etc. 
* Understand and agree on the scope with the core team near the kickoff. (Some years do full audio/visual, some years only do audio, some years use the venue's system for everything, etc.)
