## Time Expectations

TBD

## Important Dates

* **May:** Explore A/V concerns during the venue search, as needed. Visit the venue and know the scope of this year's equipment needs and a/v design. Identify any budget needs and communicate them to core team.
* **February:** Inventory the storage shed and pull equipment that will be used. Test equipment, replace consumables, make cables if necessary, and order equipment if necesary. 
* **Early March:** Get needs to volunteer organizer
* **Early April:** Train volunteers
* **Late April**: Confirm transportation, load in, and load out plan. Have all gear preloaded and organized into bins if possible.
* **May:** Set up and run pre-event checks. After the event, return to storage shed, inventory, and reorganize.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Being involved early with the venue selection is important because you need to know distances, where stages will be, what's already in place from the venue, etc. 
* Understand and agree on the scope with the core team near the kickoff. (Some years do full audio/visual, some years only do audio, some years use the venue's system for everything, etc.)
