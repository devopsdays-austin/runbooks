# Speakers/CFP

Scope:

This document is the expectations and scope of what the CFP team should be do for DevOpsDays Austin.
Most of these are points are expected, but to be completely clear this is minimal expectations.

## Role description

The CFP commitee (or team) is the group of individuals that brings the agenda together for the event. Without
the CFP committee, the event would have a challenging time bringing people together to discuss and engage
in our DevOps focused event. Many of the talks that we help curate help shape the conversations and
Open Spaces for DoD ATX, and takes commitment throughout the year to understand what would bring the
best conversations to Austin.

### General Tasks

* Engage with the Open Source communities that we are privileged to be a part of
* Vote and read all the CFPs that are proposed
* Attempt to be at every meeting for the smaller and larger team (things can change quickly and CFPs can be affected)
* Recruit or identify possible keynote speakers
* Work closely with the Sponsorship and Core team to make sure that the ratio of talks to workshops to open spaces is reasonable
* Comment or filter out "sales pitches" actively through the Open CFP process

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Spend "real time" with the CFP software before opening the CFP. It can be tricky
* You DON'T have to "promote" someone who submitted via the CFP to a keynote slot. Recruit your keynote speaker(s) as needed.
* Gain the muscle to find "sales pitches" abstracts, but don't beat yourself up if one slips through
