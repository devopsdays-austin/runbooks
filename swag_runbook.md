## Role description

The SWAG role is responsible for all things SWAG

### General Tasks

Can you name typical tasks? For example:

* Coordinating the creation of the logo
* Attendee shirts (typical 1 unique shirt per day)
* Organizer shirts
* Speaker gifts
* Attendee badges
* Sponsor Lanyards

## Important Dates

What dates are important for this role? The following headings and details are examples.

### In the beginning

* What is the theme for the conference.  This will influence the logo

### 3 Months Out

* Start the logo process.
* Identify candidates to create the logo

### 2 Months Out

* Choose the logo
* Start engage vendors on pricing based on expected attendance.
  * t shirts
  * organizer shirts
  * badges
  * lanyards
  * speaker gifts
* Choose the speaker gift and identify if there is a long production time.
* Start designing the badge. Usually the logo is involved and a double sided badge with name on both sides is preferable.  Typically the vendor will help with the desogn process.
* Start the lanyard process based on expected number of attendees.  The lanyards must at a minimum have the sponsors logo and it is nice to have the DevOpsDaysAustin logo.  A lot of time was spent back and forth about getting the DevOpsDaysAustin logo on the lanyard.

### 1 Month Out

* Order organizer shirts

### 3 Weeks out

* Start printing shirts
* Really make sure you have a handle on badges.  This was very stressful in that we were not sure they would make it in time.
### The Week Before

* Panic.

### The Day Before

* Fix up the badges if they need to be in plastic sleeves, etc
* Handout organizer shirts
* Fold T Shirts
* Hand out speaker gifts to speaker dinner.

### The Day Of

* Be Excellent

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Badges are tough.  It is a fine line between badge production time and names on badges. There are a lot of folks who sign up to attend the conference late and the fancier the badge the longer the production time.
* Try and find a local badge vendor.
* Decide on the logo early. The logner it takes to get the logo the less time you have for everything else.
