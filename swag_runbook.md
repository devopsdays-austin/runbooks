## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Badges are tough.  It is a fine line between badge production time and names on badges. There are a lot of folks who sign up to attend the conference late and the fancier the badge the longer the production time.
* Try and find a local badge vendor.
* Decide on the logo early. The logner it takes to get the logo the less time you have for everything else.
