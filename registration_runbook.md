## Role description

The role of registration is centered around the idea of selling / supplying DevOpsDays tickets to our attendees + vendors + speakers. The registration team needs to collaborate and work with other organizer teams (specifically Website, Swag, and Volunteers) since multiple areas are tightly coupled with the registration organizer team.

### General Tasks

* Setup the Ticket Registratiation Tool (Verbage, Finalize Ticket Prices, Vendor Codes, etc.).
* Work with Website and Core Organizer Team to coordinate when we should promote ticket sales (Early Bird, Normal Sale, etc.).
* Work with Swag Organizer Team to ensure we have enough t-shirts, lanyards, and badges for the total number of attendees.
* Work with Volunteer Organizer Team to properly staff registration tables each morning / afternoon of the conference.
* Various emails / reminders sent out leading up to the conference to make sure everyone understands expectations + rules.
* Typical Registration "stuff" --> Scan Tickets, Pass out Swag, ensure Attendeess are comfortable on what to expect for the conference.

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

**Important Note: Prior to 2024 we used Eventbrite (2024 will be the first year we are using the Pretix tool), so keep in mind some of the common mistakes may be framed around using the Eventbrite tool.**

* Ensure Ticket Registration does not open early (before early-bird sales date).
* Set dates for reminder emails to go out before and after the conference.
* Lock down the actual verbage of these reminders early, so we can just send it out without last minute edits / updates.
* Understand what is needed for refunding tickets.
