There are a several key elements that are needed to be done before, during, and after the conference to ensure a succesful completion of the Registration role.

## Role description

The role of registration is centered around the idea of selling / supplying DevOpsDays tickets to our attendees + vendors + speakers. The registration team needs to collaborate and work with other organizer teams (specifically Website, Swag, and Volunteers) since multiple areas are tightly coupled with the registration organizer team.

### General Tasks

Can you name typical tasks? For example:

* Setup the Ticket Registratiation Tool (Verbage, Finalize Ticket Prices, Vendor Codes, etc.).
* Work with Website Organizer Team to coordinate when we should promote ticket sales (Early Bird, Normal Sale, etc.).
* Work with Swag Organizer Team to ensure we have enough t-shirts for the total number of attendees.
* Work with Volunteer Organizer Team to properly staff registration tables each morning / afternoon of the conference.
* Various emails / reminders sent out leading up to the conference to make sure everyone understands expectations + rules.
* Typical Registration "stuff" --> Scan Tickets, Pass out Swag, ensure Attendeess are comfortable on what to expect for the conference.

## Important Dates

* February 2024 - Early Bird Ticket Sales
* March / Early April 2024 - Normal Ticket Sales
* April 2024 - Final Promotion Push Ticket Sales.
* May 2024 - Ensure Volunteer staff has been identified and understands responsibilities.

### During The Conference
* May 2024 - Reminder Emails sent out a few days prior to conference. 

### After The Conference
* May / June 2024 - SurveyMonkey emails to collect various forms of feedback (Attendee, Volunteer, Organizer, etc.) 

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

**Important Note: Prior to 2024 we used Eventbrite (2024 will be the first year we are using X tool), so keep in mind some of the common mistakes may be framed around using the Eventbrite tool.**

* Ensure Ticket Registration does not open early (before early-bird sales date).
* Set dates for reminder emails to go out before and after the conference.
* Lock down the actual verbage of these reminders early, so we can just send it out without last minute edits / updates.
* Understand what is needed for refunding tickets.
