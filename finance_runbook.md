# Finance

Ensure the budget is created and maintained. Pay all the things. Interface with ConferenceOps.

Generally, this is a core role.

## Role description

For Finance, the primary responsibility lies with the core organizers, to establish the budget prior to the conference and keep folks on track to pull off a great conference day-of while leaving enough to get things started again next year (target is $100K remaining after the conference is complete, to make a venue deposit, pay vendors before sponsorships start coming in, and pay for ongoing maintenance and conference development costs).

There is a secondary responsibility which lies with all organizers and volunteers, to keep the entire team updated with a clear understanding of what has been committed to, what has been spent, what reimbursement is needed, and any other information which would affect the financial status of the conference.

### General Tasks

* Establish budget (Core) Due [pre-kickoff](https://github.com/moutons/runbooks/blob/main/core_runbook.md), around 10 months out
* Maintain budget (Everyone) ongoing
* Perform periodic budget review (Core) 6 months prior to the conference
* Perform periodic budget review (Core) when early bird sales close
* Perform periodic budget review (Core) 3 months prior to the conference
* Submit expenses (Them what spent it, via email, add the receipt in the year's Receipts folder)
* Reimburse expenses (Core, ConferenceOps) onging
* Ensure charitable contributions are handled (Core, ConferenceOps) Due by the end of May
* Books for the year close (Core, ConferenceOps) Due in June

## TODO

* Improve reimbursement process
* 501c3? that'll complicate this function a bit but hopefully in a good way

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Keep watch on the receipts coming in, and ensure everyone is actually submitting them in real time.
* Try to get estimates in as soon as possible
* Call audibles early should you need to trim budgets before people spend too long getting quotes.
