# Finance

Ensure the budget is created and maintained. Pay all the things. Interface with ConferenceOps.

Generally, this is a core role.

## Role description

For Finance, the primary responsibility lies with the core organizers, to establish the budget prior to the conference and keep folks on track to pull off a great conference day-of while leaving enough to get things started again next year (target is $100K remaining after the conference is complete, to make a venue deposit, pay vendors before sponsorships start coming in, and pay for ongoing maintenance and conference development costs).

There is a secondary responsibility which lies with all organizers and volunteers, to keep the entire team updated with a clear understanding of what has been committed to, what has been spent, what reimbursement is needed, and any other information which would affect the financial status of the conference.

### General Tasks

* Establish budget (Core)
* Maintain budget (Everyone)
* Submit expenses (Them what spent it, via email, add the receipt in the year's Receipts folder)
* Reimburse expenses (Core, ConferenceOps)

## TODO

* Improve reimbursement process
* 501c3? that'll complicate this function a bit but hopefully in a good way

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

What do you always try to remember when you come back to this every year? Do you often find yourself scrambling for vendors? Are you always trying to remember where you left your towel? Leave notes for the next person so we can improve :)
