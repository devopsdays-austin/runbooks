# Finance

Ensure the budget is created and maintained. Pay all the things. Interface with ConferenceOps.

Generally, this is a core role.

## Role description

For Finance, the primary responsibility lies with the core organizers, to establish the budget prior to the conference and keep folks on track to pull off a great conference day-of while leaving enough to get things started again next year (target is $100K remaining after the conference is complete, to make a venue deposit, pay vendors before sponsorships start coming in, and pay for ongoing maintenance and conference development costs).

There is a secondary responsibility which lies with all organizers and volunteers, to keep the entire team updated with a clear understanding of what has been committed to, what has been spent, what reimbursement is needed, and any other information which would affect the financial status of the conference.

## Time Expectations

TBD

## TODO

* Improve reimbursement process
* 501c3? that'll complicate this function a bit but hopefully in a good way

## Reminders or Common Mistakes

* Keep watch on the receipts coming in, and ensure everyone is actually submitting them in real time.
* Try to get estimates in as soon as possible
* Call audibles early should you need to trim budgets before people spend too long getting quotes.
